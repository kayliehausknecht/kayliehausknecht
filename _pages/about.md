I am an incoming PhD student in the MIT Physics department. I recently graduated from Harvard where I studied physics and astrophysics. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to explore physics at all length scales through my undergraduate research projects. Currently, I work in Professor Michael Brenner’s lab developing fully differentiable simulations of fluids to solve inverse design problems in fluid mechanics. In my work, I model complex fluid systems in such a way that I can compute exact gradients through every step of the simulation. 

I took a gap year between my freshman and sophomore years of college when classes were fully remote and worked as a NASA intern. At NASA, I contributed to the development of new models of laminar-turbulent transition on aerospace vehicles to improve NASA’s industry flow solvers. For my next project, I joined the “ExoMiner” team at NASA Ames where I worked on building complex ML models to do exoplanet detection. Ultimately, my team identified 301 new planets in old Kepler Space Telescope data with their models, and NASA announced the discovery in a press release.
