I am currently a senior at Harvard studying physics and astrophysics. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to explore physics at all length scales through my undergraduate research projects. Currently, I work in Professor Michael Brenner’s lab developing fully differentiable simulations of fluids to solve inverse design problems in fluid mechanics. In my work, I model complex fluid systems in such a way that I can compute exact gradients through every step of the simulation. This allows me to choose a flow property, like the efficiency of mixing, and solve multi-parameter optimization problems to identify flow set-ups and geometries that maximize the desired property. I believe these methods provide exciting new ways to approach open problems in fluid mechanics, and I hope to continue exploring applications of differentiable physics simulations in graduate school.

My first research project at Harvard was in Jenny Hoffman’s lab, where I designed a new type of machine learning (ML) model to study data from scanning tunneling microscopes. I took a gap year between my freshman and sophomore years of college when classes were fully remote and worked as a NASA intern. At NASA, I contributed to the development of new models of
laminar-turbulent transition on aerospace vehicles to improve NASA’s industry flow solvers. For my next project, I joined the “ExoMiner” team at NASA Ames where I worked on building complex ML models to do exoplanet detection. Ultimately, my team identified 301 new planets in old Kepler Space Telescope data with their models, and NASA announced the discovery in a press release. I enjoyed my work there so much that I continued to intern part-time at NASA during the following school year. After that, I wrote a junior thesis in astrophysics, under the direction of Professor Avi Loeb, that explored high redshift galaxies in James Webb Space Telescope data. I have presented at seven academic conferences so far!

Throughout my time at Harvard,I have also enjoyed teaching. I have been a course assistant for classes in the mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics departments. I am the Co-President of Harvard’s chapter of Science Club for Girls, an organization that aims to help girls from underrepresented communities embrace and pursue STEM. I also served as the Undergraduate Representative to the Harvard Physics Department’s Equity and Inclusion Committee. After graduation, I hope to go on for a Ph.D. and ultimately pursue a career that will allow me to both teach and do research.
