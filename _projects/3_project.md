Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I have become very interested in exploring philosophy of physics. I have now written a few essays on the subject. Below is an essay I wrote on the "unreasonable effectivess of mathematics" problem. For this essay, I was awarded Harvard's Bowdoin Prize in the Natural Sciences.
